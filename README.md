# linear-regression-from-scratch-py
A beginner-friendly implementation of Linear Regression from scratch using only core Python libraries. This project demonstrates the fundamentals of building a machine learning model without relying on external ML frameworks like Scikit-learn or TensorFlow. Includes data preprocessing, gradient descent, model evaluation, and visualizations.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Implements linear regression using NumPy
- Fits a line to training data by minimizing Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Supports any number of features
- Visualizes predictions vs actual data
- Easy to understand, well-commented code
